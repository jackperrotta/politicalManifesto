              For thousands of years through human history, parents were certain their children's lives would be the same as theirs, even their children's, children. We’ve reached a point as a society where that is no longer the case as technology exponentially advances, we’re faced with constantly evolving lifestyles and livelihoods. In the timeframe that computers went from lumbering behemoths to nimble palm sized sidekicks, the public school system in America has largely remained unchanged. This lack of technological integration has hindered the growth and development of America’s youth, confirmed by Tina Hohlfeld in An examination of seven years of technology integration in Florida schools: Through the lens of the Levels of Digital Divide in Schools when she says, “We cannot ignore the digital equity of our K-12 system as the problem will only proliferate over time if not systematically and intentionally addressed by our administrators, legislators, and teachers. Ultimately, to resolve this divide we must continuously measure the implementation of the interventions, and the outcomes for students” (Hohlfeld). This is why schools must push to better integrate new technologies into their classrooms and give teachers the necessary training to utilize the new technologies.
              <br>
              Bringing more sophisticated technology into the classroom is not a new idea, for years their has been a push to upgrade the American public school system. One of the barriers to modernized learning has unfortunately been the the lack of utilization of available resources by the teachers themselves. Wilfried Admiraal broke teachers into five groups of technology utilization in his article Teachers in school-based technology innovations: A typology of their beliefs on teaching and technology, “Five teacher types are distinguished: 1) Learner-centered teachers with technology, 2) Teachers critical of technology use in school, 3) Teachers uncomfortable with technology, 4) Teachers uneasy with learned-centered teaching and 5) Teachers critical of a clear-cut stance.”(Admiraal). To expedite the transition to more updated learning environments, two big changes must take place. First, schools must provide adequate funding to retool their teachers so they can properly utilize the resources at their disposal. Second, unfortunately we may just have to play the waiting game as older teachers are much less inclined to use technology and new teaching methods in the classroom. The good news is, according to Sarah Sparks, once the adjustment is made the results are fantastic, “As the teachers adjusted to the new system, the school's algebra-proficiency rate climbed steadily, from 6.5 percent in 2010 to 44.8 percent scoring at "proficient" or "advanced" in 2015—even as the statewide algebra-proficiency rate dipped slightly” (Sparks). Again this is supported by Admiraal when he wrote, “We also found a relationship between the typology and years of teaching experiences with the more experienced teachers holding relatively more learner-centered beliefs on teaching and learning and less positive attitudes towards technology.” (Admiraal). Of course it’s unfair to place blame on teachers when budgets are perpetually stretched thin and the resources just aren’t available.
              <br>
              Once a school has trained its teachers and has a full buy into the new technology being
              implemented, the large capital expense must be made to acquire the equipment. Unfortunately, American school systems are strapped for cash, especially those in lower income neighborhoods, so the latest equipment doesn’t always make the cut. In Tina Hohlfeld’s article examining the “digital divides” in Florida schools over a seven year period, she broke it down to three levels, her findings are visualized in the framework below.Each level represents the amount of technological resources a school had to offer its students, and although most schools had access to some equipment, it wasn’t always up to par, “teachers in high poverty schools (greater than 50% of students on Free or Reduced Lunch Programs) had more computers than other schools; however, more of these computers were non-modern, and fewer high poverty classrooms had Internet access” (Hohlfeld). Once society recognizes these obstacles for the American public school system, we can finally realize the great advantages of utilizing emerging technologies in schools.
              <br>
              It is undeniable that students with more access to the latest technologies perform better than those who do not, as noted in Beyond Effort and Cleverness by Benson Hawk, a teacher at Newark Academy. Hawk says, “When I started in 2002, between 20 and 30 students would take AP U.S. History during their junior year, and the average test score was about a 3.7 on a 5-point scale. Today, between 50 and 55 sophomores will take AP U.S. History, and while it is always dangerous to predict outcomes, if current trends serve as a precedent, the average achievement of our students will be between 4.5 and 4.7 on a 5-point scale” (Hawk). What’s most exciting about Hawks discovery is that the technology has improved even more in the past couple years, institutions like the Navy have begun experimenting with artificial intelligence backed tutoring programs, “A separate evaluation of the Navy's intelligent-tutoring system found those who used it outperformed those using standard technical training—not just on other tests, but also on practical troubleshooting exercises. Navy staff who had been trained using the tutoring program also attempted more challenging problems and tasks than students who had been trained in other ways.” (Sparks). For the first time in history we can give every child the best teacher, a tutor that follows you and allows the student to learn at their own pace, “Some of your kids will take one day what it takes others four days to learn. In a traditional classroom, the fast students are left twiddling their thumbs. ... If you have [an ITS] engaging in a conversation with you, the tutor can just keep piling on the questions to you that are progressively more difficult” (Sparks). Customizing the lesson plan and schedule for every student is something that is simply not possible following traditional learning methods. This technological breakthrough is finally being rolled out in pilot programs across the country, Sarah Sparks documents a particularly interesting case in her article How 'Intelligent' Tutors Could Transform Teaching, “Hazelwood East High School in St. Louis is a case in point: When it started using Graesser's ALEKS intelligent-tutoring system, teachers were making a virtue of necessity. A majority of the 1,300 students there are poor and black, and the school was among the lowest performing in the state in 2010. It used a federal school improvement grant to join a pilot program to use the ALEKS tutoring system for Algebra 1, a subject in which only 6.5 percent of its students were considered proficient. The school identified incoming freshmen who had previously performed poorly in math and required them to take a double block of algebra: One 90-minute section included traditional lecturing, while the other was a 90-minute lab with ALEKS that teachers facilitated” (Sparks). It’s exciting to live in a world where socio-economic status won’t be the determining factor on whether or not a student receives a good education. If we come together and realize the potential of integrating emerging technologies into the classroom, we will give future generations the opportunity to live a more enriched life.
